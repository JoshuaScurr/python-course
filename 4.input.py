# INPUT!

# programming is literally all about I/O - we've dealt with O (using `print()`), but what about I?

# to receive input from the user, use the function `input()`
# it optionally takes one parameter, a string, which is the prompt for the user (it'll make sense in a minute)
# eg.

input("How old are you? ")

# run the program, and enter your age as instructed

# unfortunately for you, the program is currently very forgetful, so didn't bother doing anything with your answer - you need to tell it to store the information
# modify it so it now stores the answer in a variable called `age`, and the de-comment the line below (remove the `#`):

# print(f"You are {age} years old?!? You don't look it...")

# (the printing technique used above may look alien and slightly different - it's called an fstring, and we'll get to it at some point, but just assume it works for now)

# run the program and hopefully it'll chat back to you (as always - any issues, LMK)
