# PYTHON!

# this course is a programming course, not a python course, which just happens to teach programming via python. Nevertheless, there are a few python essentials you need to know:
#   - A `#` (note, all code in comments will be surrounded by `backticks`) at the start of a line represents a comment - this line is ignored by python, and so you can write whatever you like here.
#   - the extension for a python file is `.py` - notice how all but the first file ends with `.py` - this tells the computer it is a python file. File extensions are really important - whilst your file explorer probably hides them, (almost) every file you have on your computer has an extension, eg. Word files have .docx, Powerpoints have .pptx, PDFs have .pdf, etc. For normal computer usage, whatever software you're using will handle them for you, but when you're programming, you need to handle them yourself - if you don't tell the computer it's a python file, it'll have no idea what to do with it, and it'll feel very sad.
#   - to run a python file, open a terminal (Ctrl+Shift+C), then type `python {NAME_OF_FILE}` (in this case, `python 2.python.py`) and hit enter - this program should simply say "Hello world", then quit.
#   - When asked to launch in interactive mode instead, run `python -i {NAME_OF_FILE}`. To exit interactive mode, type `quit()`
#   - tabs/indentation are really important - pressing the tab key should send your cursor forward 4 spaces. Each level of indentation represents a new level of scope:

# global scope 1
# global scope 1
    # sub scope 1
    # sub scope 1
        # sub sub scope 1
    # sub scope 1
        # sub sub scope 2
# global scope 1
# global scope 1
    # sub scope 2
    # sub scope 2
        # sub sub scope 3
    # sub scope 2
# global scope 1

# If you have any queries about the above, please contact me - it's essential this is fully understood before proceeding.


print("Hello world")

# run this program

# to output to the terminal (the standard way of communication to the user when doing any sort of programming), the syntax is `print({STRING TO OUTPUT})`
# a string is a series of characters. they are represented by surrounding the characters by "quotes" - see the "Hello world" above.

# create your own print statment below that tells the user what your name is, and then run it
